# ToDoList

A simple SwiftUI ToDo app. Currently in further development.
The app is using CoreData to store information. For now, the user can set the priority of the newly created task, its planned completion date, check whether the task has been done and delete the task when no longer needed.
The user can also see their tasks' dates displayed in a calendar view on another tab.
The calendar view will in the future allow the user to select the dates to view more details about selected task and edit it.
